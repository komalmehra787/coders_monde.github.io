    <p class="medium-heading">What is RDBMS ?</p>
    <p class="tutcontent-description">
    RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
</p>
  <p class="tutcontent-description">  All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL, and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.
    </p>
 <p class="tutcontent-description">   It is called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.
    </p>
   <p class="small-heading"> How it works</p>
  <p class="tutcontent-description">  Data is represented in terms of tuples (rows) in RDBMS.</p>
    
  <p class="tutcontent-description">  A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables, and each table has its primary key.
    </p>
  <p class="tutcontent-description">  Due to a collection of an organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.</p>
