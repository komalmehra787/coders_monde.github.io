    <p class="tutcontent-description">PL/SQL is a block structured language. The programs of PL/SQL are logical blocks that can contain any number of nested sub-blocks. Pl/SQL stands for "Procedural Language extension of SQL" that is used in Oracle. PL/SQL is integrated with Oracle database (since version 7).
        
    </p>
    <p class="tutcontent-description">PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers. It can support Array and handle exceptions (runtime errors). </p>
    <p class="tutcontent-description">PL/SQL is not case sensitive so you are free to use lower case letters or upper case letters except within string and character literals.</p>
    <p class="tutcontent-description">The PL/SQL is known for its combination of data manipulating power of SQL with data processing power of procedural languages. It inherits the robustness, security, and portability of the Oracle Database.</p>
