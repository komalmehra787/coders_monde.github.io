                        <p class="tutcontent-description">The basic client/server architecture is used to deal with a large number of PCs, web servers, database servers and other components that are connected with networks.
                            The client/server architecture consists of many PCs and a workstation which are connected via the network.</p>

                            DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to the database to get their request done.</p>

<p class="tutcontent-description">
                Database architecture can be seen as a single tier or multi-tier. But logically, database architecture is of two types like: 2-tier architecture and 3-tier architecture.
</p>
<p class="tutcontent-subheading">
                1-Tier Architecture</p>
                <p class="tutcontent-description">
                In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it.</p>
                <p class="tutcontent-description">
                Any changes done here will directly be done on the database itself. It doesn't provide a handy tool for end users.</p>
                <p class="tutcontent-description">
                The 1-Tier architecture is used for development of the local application, where programmers can directly communicate with the database for the quick response.</p>
               <p class="tutcontent-subheading"> 2-Tier Architecture</p>
              <p class="tutcontent-description">  The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction, API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used.</p>
              <p class="tutcontent-description">  The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side.</p>
               <p class="tutcontent-description"> The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management.</p>
              <p class="tutcontent-description">  To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.</p>
            
                
                <p class="tutcontent-subheading">3-Tier Architecture</p>

                <p class="tutcontent-description">
                The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture, client can't directly communicate with the server. </p>
             <p class="tutcontent-description">   The application on the client-end interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system. </p>
              <p class="tutcontent-description">  End user has no idea about the existence of the database beyond the application server. The database also has no idea about any other user beyond the application.
                The 3-Tier architecture is used in case of large web application. </p>
